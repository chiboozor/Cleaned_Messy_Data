# Cleaned_Messy_Data
A dummy data containing 100 rows of movie titles, and 8 columns showing parameters by which they are judged.
I simply cleaned this dataset as a way to practice that which I was taught in a bootcamp, and it took me fairly a large amount of time.
The columns had a lot of unrecognizable characters because the CSV file encoding. I took a lot of time to clean the dataset, and the procedures were well stated in the notebook below. 
There are no visualizations to show any reports, but that would be worked on in due time. 
Enjoy perusing through my notebook and feel free to make changes as it would also help my learning process. 

I am open to criticism. Thank you.
